## Purpose
We are developing 'HAN-OL', a poetry recommendation service designed to deliver emotional comfort and healing

> ðŸŒ¿ **Hanol** is a poetry recommendation service crafted to bring emotional comfort and healing.
>
> ðŸ§  Our goal is to generate poems that resonate with each userâ€™s **unique psychological state** â€” not just text, but words that understand.
>
> ðŸ’¬ To achieve this, we fine-tune `KoGPT2` with a focus on **emotional nuance and empathy**.
>
> ðŸ”§ A *custom-designed loss function* helps guide the model to better reflect subtle human feelings in its poetic output.
>
> â€” Let machines write, but let them write **with feeling.**
